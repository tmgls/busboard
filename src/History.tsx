            <p>
                Londonâ€™s iconic buses have come a long way since the 19th century. The first buses in London were actually horse-drawn and began operating in 1829, running from Paddington to the City of London.

                By the early 1900s, motorized buses began to replace the horse-drawn versions. In 1909, the London General Omnibus Company (LGOC) introduced the famous B-type bus, which was the first mass-produced bus in the world.

                Perhaps the most iconic of all is the red Routemaster, introduced in the 1950s. These double-decker buses became a global symbol of London. Although most were retired from regular service in the early 2000s, a few still operate on heritage routes.

            <p>
                Today, London buses are fully accessible, modern, and environmentally friendly. The city has been investing in hybrid and electric buses as part of its sustainability goals.
